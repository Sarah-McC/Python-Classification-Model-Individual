# Python-Classification-Model-Individual
In this assignment, you are tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a binomial response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

Criteria 1 – Response Variable Usage

The response variable cannot used in any form as an explanatory variable (the Y-variable cannot be used on the X-side).

 

Violation Penalty

Both of the following will occur if the response variable was used as an explanatory variable:

The model will be rerun after this variable has been removed.
Your final model points will be reduced by 0.025.
 

 

Criteria 2 – Model Types

Model types are appropriate for the task at hand and come from statsmodels or scikit-learn (other packages and engines are not permitted).

 

Permitted Model Types

Logistic Regression
Lasso Regression (Classification)
K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
Classification Trees
Random Forest (Classification)
Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)
